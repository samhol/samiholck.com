#WHY? <small>what is the purpose of....</small>

<blockquote markdown="1">
Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking 
big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and 
electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental 
insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. 
Choose your friends. Choose leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a 
three-piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY 
and wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that 
couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk 
food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your 
last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, 
fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose 
life… But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. 
I chose somethin’ else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons 
when you’ve got heroin?”
